1) From my understanding, of the equation F = G (M1 * M2) / D^2, it seems that would 
mean that an asteroid a fraction of the size of the earth has the same pull on the earth
that the earth would have on the asteroid. In my simulation this means that the earth and the asteroid
both go flying when they get too close to each other.
* Hypothesis- This would be the case in the universe when there is nothing of great enough mass 
keeping things balanced
  * ex. the sun is keeping the earth and the moon in balance

2) in all of my simulations there is a clear pattern of the objects "orbiting" (haven't had a 
good simulation of an orbit yet) clockwise, and running to the right. 
* I still believe that must be a glitch in my simulations
