# Physics-Simulation

This is a simulation of the basic affect of gravity on planets and other astronomical objects.

## Please Note

I am a beginner level student and I am aware there are many faults in my code. If you see something here that you believe is bad coding practice or is implemented poorly, please let me know and I will try my best to fix it or make it more efficient. This project is a learning experience for me and I would appreciate any feedback I get.
